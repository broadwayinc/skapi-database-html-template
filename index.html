        This is a HTML example for building photo uploading application using
        <a href="https://www.skapi.com">Skapi</a>.
        <br />
        No fancy CSS is used in this example.
        <br />
        <br />
        This example features complex database examples such as uploading an
        image file, posting private data, comments, like button, searching photo
        by hashtag etc - all within a single HTML file.
        <br /><br />
        Users can upload their own photos and view other users' photos after
        logging in. Authentication part is simplified to just two pages -
        login.html and signup.html.
    </p>
    <a href="login.html">Login</a>
    |
    <a href="signup.html">Sign-Up</a>
